My name is Atakan, and I am a senior software engineering student. I am passionate about Android development and enjoy coding with Java and Kotlin. Currently, I am working on developing a notebook app that is available on the Google Play Store. I have learned a lot from this project and am continually refining my skills to improve it further. I'm excited to use my skills in the software industry to help a company succeed and eager to explore new opportunities.
